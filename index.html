So Dave pressed the start button, the computer booted up, the screen came alive, and everything Dave knew to be true no longer was.</p>

                    <p>The thing that's great about this job is the time sourcing the items involves no traveling. I just look online to buy it. It's really as simple as that. While everyone else is searching for what they can sell, I sit in front of my computer and buy better stuff for less money and spend a fraction of the time doing it.</p>
